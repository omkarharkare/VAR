# Project Declaration

## Project Name  
**Educational Multi-View Foul Detection in Soccer**

## Description  
This project is an educational initiative utilizing the publicly available SoccerNet dataset to explore *Multi-View Foul (MVFoul)* detection in soccer matches. The primary objective is to develop and analyze deep learning models for automatic foul detection using data from multiple camera perspectives. This work is intended solely for educational and research purposes, without any commercial application.

## Key Components  
1. **SoccerNet Dataset**: Employing the SoccerNet dataset as the foundation for training and evaluation.  
2. **ResNetR3D Architecture**: Implementing and experimenting with the ResNetR3D model for video classification tasks.  
3. **TwoStreamModel Approach**: Investigating a two-stream architecture to improve foul detection performance.  
4. **PyTorch Framework**: Utilizing PyTorch as the primary framework for deep learning model development and experimentation.

## Goals  
- Acquire hands-on experience in developing machine learning models for foul detection in soccer matches.  
- Investigate the role of multi-view camera setups in enhancing detection accuracy.  
- Understand challenges, methodologies, and evaluation techniques in video-based event detection systems.

## Educational Purpose  
This project is strictly intended for educational and research purposes. It is not designed for commercial applications or deployment in real-world sports officiating systems.

## Reference Usage  
The *sn-mvfoul* project serves solely as a reference to understand the problem domain and its evaluation metrics. No code or proprietary assets from *sn-mvfoul* are utilized or modified in this project.

This project is not officially affiliated with SoccerNet or any other referenced projects. It builds upon publicly available datasets and concepts for academic exploration only.
