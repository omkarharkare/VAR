Project Declaration

Project Name: Educational Multi-View Foul Detection in Soccer

Description:
This project is an educational endeavor based on the SoccerNet dataset, focusing on Multi-View Foul (MVFoul) detection in soccer matches. It aims to develop and explore deep learning models for automatic foul detection using multiple camera views. This project is for educational and research purposes only.

Key Components:
1. SoccerNet Dataset: Utilizing the SoccerNet dataset for training and evaluation.
2. ResNetR3D: Implementing and exploring the ResNetR3D architecture for video classification.
3. TwoStreamModel: Investigating the two-stream approach for foul detection.
4. PyTorch Implementation: Using PyTorch as the primary deep learning framework.

Goals:
- Gain practical experience in developing models for foul detection in soccer matches.
- Explore the use of multiple camera views to enhance detection performance.
- Understand the challenges and techniques in video-based event detection.

Educational Purpose:
This project is solely for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for commercial use or deployment in real-world scenarios.

Reference:
The sn-mvfoul project is used purely for reference purposes to understand the problem domain and evaluation metrics. This project does not use or modify any code from sn-mvfoul directly.

This project is not officially affiliated with SoccerNet or any other mentioned projects. It builds upon publicly available datasets and concepts for educational exploration.
