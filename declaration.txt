Project Name: Multi-View Foul Detection in Soccer  

Description:  
This project is an educational initiative utilizing the publicly available SoccerNet dataset to explore Multi-View Foul (MVFoul) detection in soccer matches. The primary objective is to develop and analyze deep learning models for automatic foul detection using data from multiple camera perspectives. This work is intended solely for educational and research purposes, without any commercial application.
